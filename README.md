## Why did I make this
So here's the story:
My friend and I are in math class. We're solving a system of equations, and our teacher gives us this PDF about something called... Cramer's Rule? What?
It's this thing involving matrices and determinants and stuff. If you want to read it, [here ya go, nerd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule)

So basically, this program uses Cramer's Rule to solve the system of equations. ðŸ¤¯

## What does this do bruh
Do you not understand<br>
It solves a system of equations using âœ¨ **_Cramer's Rule_** âœ¨

## So what now
Use the program.
We're thinking about creating an entire website for this, since I'm really bored and stupid and thought it would be cool to do ig.

Have fun with the program. :)
