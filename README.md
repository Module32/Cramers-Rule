## Why did I make this
So here's the story:
My friend and I are in math class. We're solving a system of equations, and our teacher gives us this PDF about something called Cramer's Rule.
It's this thing involving matrices and determinants and stuff. If you want to read about it, [here you go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule)
So us naturally being lazy made a website to do the computations for us

So basically, this program uses Cramer's Rule to solve the system of equations. ðŸ¤¯

## What does this do
It solves a system of equations using âœ¨ **_Cramer's Rule_** âœ¨

## So what now
Have fun with the website and stuff
